## General

- Migrated source code to Swift 3.0
- Now Support Swift Package Manager
- Improved files and source code layout
- More documentation

## Performance

A benchmark was added to test the performance of the library.

An internal design modification greatly improved the parsing speed and memory
usage. Before the modification the benchmark measured 648.32s (â‰ˆ10.8m) to
execute the parsing of a huge JSON file. Now it only takes 6.7s, a bit more than
96 times faster!

## API

- Added the `userState: GenericParser<StreamType, UserState, UserState>`
parser.
- Now the `run(userState: UserState, sourceName: String, input: StreamType)
throws -> Result` only returns the result of the parsing. As an example, if one
wants to get the user state and the result at the same time:
```
let countLine = GenericParser<String, Int, Character>.endOfLine >>- { newLine in

    GenericParser<String, Int, Int>.userState >>- { userState in

        GenericParser(result: (newLine, userState + 1))

    }

}

```
- Added the `Parsec.runSafe(userState: UserState, sourceName: String,
input: StreamType) -> Either<ParseError, Result>` method. This new method does
not throw exceptions but returns the result wrap in an `Either` type.
- Added a parser returning the current source position:
`GenericParser.sourcePosition: GenericParser<StreamType, UserState, SourcePosition>`
- Various minor changes to conform to the Swift API design guide lines

# Release 1.1

- Added missing guard statement to prevent crash in `UnicodeScalar.fromUInt32()`
- Added `ClosedInterval` variant of `ParsecType.oneOf()`
- Migration to Swift 2.2
- Internal code improvement
- Increased tests coverage
- Documentation improvement
